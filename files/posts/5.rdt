How does the SARS 2 virus infect a cell via ACE2?
 Is it that the virus's binding damages the protein or else causes it to malfunction in some way, and then the cell recognizes that damage and so tries to retrieve it for repair or replacement, and in doing so, the whole virus gets pulled in along with it?
