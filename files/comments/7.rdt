Problem with that is 19 out of the 20+ are for completely uninteresting jobs. I specifically write that I am only looking for 100% remote (have been remote for 15 years now), and Angular, .net and SQL Server. But I constantly get barraged with react + node/java jobs that I couldn't care less about.
